# Student_List_analysis
I am using a class to get a file with students in different cohorts who are from different countries and returns countries solo-reps and print cohorts details after you entered a country

I am using a class

The class constructor constructs the dictionaries that I created. The first dictionary contains all the countries, names and cohorts of students. 

The second Dictionary contains the details about cohorts based on the country.

It will work after you have gave it a file to work with that is in the order of Student name, Country and Cohort
